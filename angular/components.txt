Life Cycle:

Order of Operations
-------------------
 1. User has clicked on navbar item
 2. Router does it "canActivate" check
	-- Is the router allowed to open this page?
	-- If allowed, proceeed
	-- If not, redirect the user to the "Denied" page


 3. Router creates a new **INSTANCE** of the page component

		let page: ScrollIntoView = new ScrollIntoView()


 4. Constructor gets called
	-- Any passed-in injectable services are injected


 5. ngOnInit() method is called    [if it's there]


 6. Render our HTML
	-- Any Template Variables are created


 7. ngAfterViewInit()
	-- At this point, the HTML is rendered
	-- I can now get the height of a div using the template variable here

	-- You can set the focus on a textbox here in code


 8. User can start using the page

 --------------------------------

 9. User leaves the page
    a. Router checks to see if the user is allowed to leave

    b. Router calls the ngOnDestroy() method

    c. Router destroys the component
