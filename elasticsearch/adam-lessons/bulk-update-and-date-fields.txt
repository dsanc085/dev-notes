Recap
 ------
 1. When doing a bulk update, 99% of the time, I use the

			POST _bulk?refresh=wait_for                # Make this a synchronous REST call ***AND*** wait for the next refresh cycle
														 + When this finishes, the data is searchable
														 - This might cost you 1 whole second of wait time!!!
                                                                                    ^
                                                                                    |
                                                                                refresh interval


			POST _bulk                                  # This is fucking asynchronous!!!  So, you don't know when the results are public




 2. Date fields are really powerful
	a. You can search and index as many formats as you want:  Just keep separating them with the ||
	b. If you *STORE* the date field as 1234567890, then this is the crappy format you get by default
	   SUGGESTION:  *STORE* the data field in the format you need so you can *RETURN* the data in the *CORRECT* format
					+ The frontend doesn't have to reformat your fucking dates!!!
					+ The backend doesn't have to reformat your fucking dates


		If your sync-service, *STORES* the dates in the correct format, you don't have to do any *REFORMATTING*



    c. You can do date range searches

		created_date:[01/01/2020 TO 12/31/2024]

		created_date:[now-1y TO now}

		created_date:[now-30d TO now]     # last 30 days




	d. Users like to search dates using wildcards.  So, let them
		-- By adding a sub-field to your date with type:text

				"created_date": {
					"type": "date",
					"format": "mm/dd/yyyy||yyyy-mmdd""


					"fields": {

						"text" : {
							"type": "text"
							"analyzer": "whitespace"
						}
					}
				}


					Search box:     03*2024 ----> matches every date in March 2024
